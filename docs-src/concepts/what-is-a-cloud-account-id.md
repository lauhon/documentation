The identifier remains constant for the entire time a customer uses Temporal Cloud.

To find an Account Id, follow these steps:

1. Log into Temporal Cloud.
2. Navigate to the Namespace list page from the left-side vertical navigation.

The Account Id is the alphanumeric character string found after the period in any Cloud Namespace name.

To view Namespace information from the command line instead of the Web, use the `tcld` CLI utility.
Follow these steps:
1. Log in: `tcld login`.
2. Issue `tcld namespace list`.

The Account Id is the alphanumeric character string found after the period in any Cloud Namespace name.
